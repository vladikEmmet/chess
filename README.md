# Chess Web Application
**The project was created as a trial work with OOP and TypeScript. The result is a web application for playing chess alone, solving chess problems and playing with AI (6 chess engines of varying complexity are presented)**

## Project advantages:
- **All-in-one format.** The project includes 3 different modes for playing chess;
- **Simple and intuitive interface.** The project is designed for users of all ages and levels of chess proficiency;
- **High-quality AI.** The project includes 6 chess engines of varying complexity;

## Future work on the project will focus on:
- Development of adaptive and responsive design;
- Optimizing the application;
- Complete rejection of libraries used to display the graphical interface of the board (currently necessary for correct interaction with chess engines via the [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) protocol);
- Bug fix;
